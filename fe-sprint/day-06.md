# Day 06 — Final Expense Sprint

---

## Call Script

**Opening:**
"Hi, may I speak with [Name]? ... Hi [Name], my name is Dustin. I'm a local life insurance agent — the reason I'm calling is we sent you some information about a final expense life insurance program that covers burial and funeral costs so your family doesn't have that burden. Did you get a chance to look at that?"

**If yes / maybe:**
"Great. This is a whole life policy — it never goes up in price, never goes down in value, and can never be cancelled as long as you pay the premium. Were you looking for something to cover just the basics, or a little more to leave behind for family?"

**If no:**
"No problem — that's exactly why I'm calling. I just want to take 2 minutes and share what we have. You're under no obligation. Do you have a quick second?"

**Benefit statement:**
"We work with several A-rated carriers. Most people your age qualify for $5,000–$25,000 in coverage starting around $30–$50 a month. The benefit goes directly to whoever you choose — no waiting period for most approvals."

**Appointment close:**
"What I'd like to do is go over your options and get you an exact quote — it only takes about 15 minutes. Would [day] or [day] work better for you?"

**Common objection — need to think about it:**
"I understand. What specifically were you wanting to think over? ... [Listen] ... Most people tell me that once they see the actual numbers it makes the decision a lot easier. Can we just get you the quote first?"

**Common objection — can't afford it:**
"That's actually the most common concern I hear. The good news is we have options starting under $30 a month. Would it be worth 15 minutes to at least see what's available to you?"

**Common objection — already have coverage:**
"That's great to hear. A lot of people I talk to have some coverage through work or a group plan — the challenge is those often don't follow you or they cut off at a certain age. Would you mind if I just took a quick look to make sure you're fully covered?"

**Close:**
"I want to make sure your family is protected. Let me get your information and we'll get this taken care of today."

### Objections

**"I need to think about it."**
"What part do you want to think over? ... Let's get the quote first — most people tell me seeing the number makes the decision easy."

**"I can't afford it."**
"We have options under $30/mo. Worth 15 min to see what's available?"

**"I already have coverage."**
"Great. Does it follow you if you leave work, and does it go up with age? Let me make sure you're not going to have a gap."

**"My kids will handle it."**
"I hear that a lot. The average funeral runs $12,000–$15,000. Would you want that coming out of their pocket right when they're grieving?"

**"Send me something in the mail."**
"I can do that, but the rates I can offer you today aren't guaranteed by mail. Takes 15 min now and you'll have your answer today."

**"I'm not interested."**
"I understand. Just out of curiosity — do you have something in place already for final expenses, or is it just not a priority right now?"
