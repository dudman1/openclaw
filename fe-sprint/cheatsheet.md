## Objections

**"I need to think about it."**
"What part do you want to think over? ... Let's get the quote first — most people tell me seeing the number makes the decision easy."

**"I can't afford it."**
"We have options under $30/mo. Worth 15 min to see what's available?"

**"I already have coverage."**
"Great. Does it follow you if you leave work, and does it go up with age? Let me make sure you're not going to have a gap."

**"My kids will handle it."**
"I hear that a lot. The average funeral runs $12,000–$15,000. Would you want that coming out of their pocket right when they're grieving?"

**"Send me something in the mail."**
"I can do that, but the rates I can offer you today aren't guaranteed by mail. Takes 15 min now and you'll have your answer today."

**"I'm not interested."**
"I understand. Just out of curiosity — do you have something in place already for final expenses, or is it just not a priority right now?"
